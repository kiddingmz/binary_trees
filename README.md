# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

## Data structures
Please use the following data structures and types for binary trees. Don’t forget to include them in your header file.

### Basic Binary Tree
```
/**
 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
 */
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};

typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;
```

### Binary Search Tree
```
typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;
```

### AVL Tree
```
typedef struct binary_tree_s avl_t;
```

### Max Binary Heap
```
typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t;
```

## Print function
To match the examples in the tasks, you are given this function ( https://github.com/alx-tools/0x1C.c )

This function is used only for visualization purposes. You don’t have to push it to your repo. It may not be used during the correction
